# Do your tasks

<a href="https://tasksandcats.netlify.app" target="_blank">Do your tasks (check me out!)</a>

This project was built with but not limited to:

* TypeScript
* React
* React-dnd
* styled-components

## Summary

Main purpose of this application is to be a minimalistic web app to organise your daily tasks with drag and drop features on cards and columns.

I built this web app to control my tasks without using external applications such as trello and notion which feels too heavy on daily usage.
